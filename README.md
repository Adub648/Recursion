# Recursion

Two ruby files with separate algorithms.

The `fibonacci.rb` file contains two algorithms that determine a certain amount of numbers in the fibonacci sequence, both using iteration and recursion.

The `merge_sort.rb` file contains an algorithm that sorts an and outputs an array using the [merge sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_sort) sorting algorithm, created through the use of recursion.

# What I struggled with

I was able to get the fibonnaci algorithms pretty easily but I struggled to understand some parts of the merge sort algorithm and had to do some researching to work out some parts of it. I got a bit confused with the base case of the algorithm as well as not putting merge in a seperate function, which I was able to implement upon research.
